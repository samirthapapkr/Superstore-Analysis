## Project Background

This project aims to analyze the performance of a retail business using the Superstore dataset in Tableau. The goal was to build interactive dashboards to extract actionable insights into sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior for the year 2023, and benchmark them against 2022 performance.

The dashboards are split into:
**Customer Dashboard**: to understand customer engagement and value.
**Sales Dashboard**:  to evaluate product-level performance and revenue drivers.
