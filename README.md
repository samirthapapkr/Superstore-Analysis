# Superstore-Analysis

This repository is part of a comprehensive data analytics pipeline for the popular Superstore dataset. The project is divided into three main repositories that together demonstrate a complete data analytics lifecycle‚Äîfrom raw data ingestion to business insights and visual storytelling.

---

**Repository Overview**

1. **Data Warehouse**
Cleaning, transforming, and structuring raw data into bronze, silver, and gold layers.

2. **Data Analysis**
Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and advanced SQL-based analytics.

3. **Data Visualization**
Creating an interactive dashboard in Tableau and business reports for decision-making.

---

**Data Warehousing**
#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

1. **Bronze Layer**
- Raw ingestion of the Superstore dataset (CSV format).
- Minimal transformation.
- Focus: data persistence, schema consistency.

2. **Silver Layer**
- Cleaned and standardized data.
- Null handling, data type conversions, and basic derived columns.
- Dimensional modeling started (e.g., date dimensions, product hierarchies).

3.**Gold Layer**
- Finalized tables used for analysis and reporting.
- Includes:
- Profitability by Region/Product
-Customer segmentation
- Time-series sales trends
- Fully optimized for downstream BI tools.
- Tools Used: Postresql

### Data Analysis (Exploratory & Advanced Analytics)

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Understand dataset structure
- Missing value analysis
- Outlier detection
- Descriptive statistics
- Category-wise trends (Sales, Profit, Quantity)

2. **Advanced SQL Analytics**
- Window functions for running totals, moving averages
- Cohort analysis for customer retention
- RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- Market Basket Analysis using association rules (optional)
- Profit margin trends by segment, category, sub-category
- Tools Used: Postgresql
